# A Robust Domain Adversarial Learning Approach for Parkinson’s Disease Severity Assessment
This is the code for the paper titled 'A Robust Domain Adversarial Learning Approach for Parkinson’s Disease Severity Assessment,' which has been submitted at ICASSP 2025.



## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Degenerative Disease (DD) using a robust domain adversarial learning approach. This repository includes the code and data for **Task 1**.

## Requirements

To get started, first install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the code for Task 1. Since only Task 1 data is provided in the repository, the code is set up to classify between PD and DD based on this dataset.

To execute Task 1, run:

```
python our_1_class.py
```

This script will load the Task 1 data and perform the classification of PD and DD.

## Notes

- **Task 1** focuses on classifying Parkinson's Disease (PD) vs. Degenerative Disease (DD).
- Only Task 1 data is available in this repository. For other tasks, please refer to the paper for more details.

## Datasets

- **PADS**: [https://physionet.org/content/parkinsons-disease-smartwatch/1.0.0/](https://physionet.org/content/parkinsons-disease-smartwatch/1.0.0/) - 

- **Private Dataset**: Fully prepared and ready for release, currently under review for public access.
